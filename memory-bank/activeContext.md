3. Testing Results:
   - Endpoint returns correct status code and headers
   - Archive contains all required files
   - Proper file permissions maintained
   - Hidden files correctly excluded

## Current Status
✅ Feature complete and tested
✅ Core documentation updated
✅ Changes committed to git

## Next Steps
1. Create backend/docs structure
2. Document download endpoint:
   - Request format
   - Response headers
   - Response format
   - Example usage
   - Error conditions
3. Monitor for production issues
4. Consider archive size limits
