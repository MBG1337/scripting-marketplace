# Active Development Context

## Current Session Context
[2024-02-24 15:32]

Just completed initial backend setup with Go. Backend will run on port 5019, with frontend planned for port 5020 (both will be proxied behind nginx). Following git-based workflow with commits after each significant change and testing each implementation.

## Current Phase
Phase 1: Backend Development (Initial Setup)

## Active Goals
1. âœ“ Set up Go project structure
2. Begin implementing file server functionality
3. Design initial API endpoints

## Implementation Focus
- File server setup for script distribution
- Core API endpoint implementation:
  - GET /api/scripts
  - GET /api/scripts/:name
  - GET /api/download/:name
  - GET /api/tags
  - GET /api/search

## Configuration Details
- Backend Port: 5019
- Frontend Port: 5020 (upcoming)
- Deployment: Will be proxied behind nginx

## Working Practices
- Commit after every significant change
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Atomic commits focused on single features/changes
- Test functionality after each implementation:
  * Run server and verify endpoints
  * Test with curl/http tools
  * Verify file operations
  * Check error handling

## Testing Strategy
For each implementation:
1. Start the server
2. Test basic functionality
3. Test edge cases
4. Verify error handling
5. Document test results in commits

## Open Questions
1. API versioning strategy
2. Rate limiting implementation details
3. Script validation process specifics during PR review

## Current Technical Stack
- Backend: Go
- Frontend: NextJS with TypeScript
- Storage: File system based script repository

## Latest Commit
- Initialize Go backend structure with basic server setup
- Set up project directory structure
- Configure server on port 5019
