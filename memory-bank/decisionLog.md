# Decision Log

## [2024-02-24] - Initial Architecture Decisions

### Backend Technology Selection: Go
**Context:** Need for efficient file serving and API implementation
**Decision:** Using Go for the backend implementation
**Rationale:**
- Excellent performance for file serving
- Strong standard library support
- Good concurrency handling
- Easy deployment

### Frontend Framework: NextJS with TypeScript
**Context:** Need for a robust, type-safe frontend implementation
**Decision:** Using NextJS with TypeScript
**Rationale:**
- Built-in routing and SSR capabilities
- TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Good performance characteristics

### Storage Strategy: File System Based
**Context:** Need for script storage and distribution
**Decision:** Using file system based storage for scripts
**Rationale:**
- Simple and direct access to script files
- Easy backup and version control integration
- Straightforward PR-based contribution workflow
- No need for complex database operations

### Script Structure Design
**Context:** Need for consistent script organization
**Decision:** Implemented structured directory format for scripts
```
scripts/
  script-name/
    main.json
    script-name.lua
    [additional files]
```
**Rationale:**
- Clear organization of script files
- Metadata separation (main.json)
- Support for additional resources
- Easy validation and processing

### API Design
**Context:** Need for script management and distribution
**Decision:** RESTful API with specific endpoints for script management
**Rationale:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Straightforward integration with frontend
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Standard HTTP methods for operations
