### Backend File Server Implementation

#### Completed Tasks
1. Created script handler implementation:
   - File serving functionality in `internal/api/handlers/scripts/handler.go`
   - Directory traversal with security checks
   - Proper content-type handling

2. Added endpoints:
   - GET /api/scripts - Lists available scripts with metadata
   - GET /api/scripts/{script-id}/{filename} - Serves script files

3. Implemented security measures:
   - Path traversal prevention
   - File access validation
   - Error handling for missing files

4. Set up script structure in correct location:
   ```
   backend/
     scripts/              # Scripts directory within backend
       test-script/        # Example script
         main.json        # Script metadata
         test-script.lua  # Script file
   ```

5. Directory Structure Changes:
   - Moved scripts directory inside backend/
   - Updated main.go to use correct relative path
   - Verified working with new location

#### Testing Results
- ✓ GET /api/scripts returns correct script listing
- ✓ GET /api/scripts/test-script/test-script.lua serves file correctly
- ✓ Error handling works for non-existent files
- ✓ Security measures prevent directory traversal

#### Final Configuration
- Server running on port 5019
- Scripts located in backend/scripts/
- All endpoints functioning as expected
